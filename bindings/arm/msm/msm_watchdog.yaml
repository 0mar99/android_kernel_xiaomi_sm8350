description: |+
  Watchdog timer is configured with a bark and a bite time.
  If the watchdog is not "pet" at regular intervals, the system
  is assumed to have become non responsive and needs to be reset.
  A warning in the form of a bark timeout leads to a bark interrupt
  and a kernel panic. If the watchdog timer is still not reset,
  a bite timeout occurs, which is an interrupt in the secure mode,
  which leads to a reset of the SOC via the secure watchdog. The
  driver needs the petting time, and the bark timeout to be programmed
  into the watchdog, as well as the bark and bite irqs.

  The device tree parameters for the watchdog are:

properties:
  compatible:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <string>
    Definition: Must be "qcom,msm-watchdog"

  reg:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
    Definition: offset and length of the register set for the watchdog block.

  reg-names:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <string>
    Definition: names corresponding to each reg property value (base required).
          "wdt-base" - physical base address of watchdog timer registers
          "wdt-absent-base" - physical base address of watchdog absent register

  interrupts:
     Usage: required
     Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
     Definition: should contain bark and bite irq numbers

  qcom,pet-time:
     Usage: required
     Value type: <u32>
     Definition: Non zero time interval at which watchdog should be pet in ms.

  qcom,bark-time:
     Usage: required
     Value type: <u32>
     Definition: Non zero timeout value for a watchdog bark in ms.

  qcom,userspace-watchdog:
     Usage: optional
     Value type: <boolean>
     Definition: Allow enabling the userspace-watchdog feature. This feature
          requires userspace to pet the watchdog every qcom,pet-time interval
          in addition to the existing kernel-level checks.
          This feature is supported through device sysfs files.

  qcom,ipi-ping:
     Usage: optional
     Value type: <boolean>
     Definition: send keep alive ping to other cpus if present

  qcom,wakeup-enable:
     Usage: optional
     Value type: <boolean>
     Definition: enable non secure watchdog to freeze / unfreeze
          automatically across suspend / resume path.

example:
  - |
    wdog: qcom,wdt@17c10000{
	compatible = "qcom,msm-watchdog";
	reg = <0x17c10000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "wdt-base";
	interrupts = <0 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                <0 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	qcom,bark-time = <11000>;
	qcom,pet-time = <9360>;
	qcom,ipi-ping;
	qcom,wakeup-enable;
    };
