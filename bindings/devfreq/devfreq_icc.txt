MSM devfreq icc device

devfreq icc is a device that represents a MSM device's BW requirements from its
master port(s) to a different device's slave port(s) in a MSM SoC. This
device is typically used to vote for BW requirements from a device's (Eg:
CPU, GPU) master port(s) to the slave (Eg: DDR) port(s).

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,devfreq-icc"
- interconnects:	Pairs of phandles and interconnect provider specificers
			to denote the edge source and destination ports of the
			desired interconnect path.
- qcom,bw-tbl:		A list of meaningful instantaneous bandwidth values
			(in MB/s) that can be requested from the device
			master port to the slave port. The list of values
			depend on the supported bus/slave frequencies and the
			bus width.

Optional properties:
- qcom,active-only:	Indicates that the bandwidth votes need to be
			enforced only when the CPU subsystem is active.
- governor:		Initial governor to use for the device.
			Default: "performance"

Example:

	qcom,cpubw {
		compatible = "qcom,devfreq-icc";
		interconnects = <&mc_virt MASTER_LLCC &mc_virt SLAVE_EBI1>;
		qcom,active-only;
		qcom,bw-tbl =
			<  572 /*  75 MHz */ >,
			< 1144 /* 150 MHz */ >,
			< 1525 /* 200 MHz */ >,
			< 2342 /* 307 MHz */ >,
			< 3509 /* 460 MHz */ >,
			< 4684 /* 614 MHz */ >,
			< 6103 /* 800 MHz */ >,
			< 7102 /* 931 MHz */ >;
	};
