	---help---
	  Say Y if you intend to use Qualcomm IPC router protocol.  The
	  protocol is used to communicate with services provided by other
	  hardware blocks in the system.

	  In order to do service lookups, a userspace daemon is required to
	  maintain a service listing.

config QRTR_NODE_ID
	int "QRTR Local Node ID"
	default 1
	help
	  This option is used to configure the QRTR Node ID for the local
	  processor. The node ID published to other nodes within the system.
	  This value can be overridden by the name service application. This
	  option is for configurations where Node ID needs to be customized
	  but the name service application is not priveleged enough to use
	  netlink sockets.

config QRTR_SMD
	tristate "SMD IPC Router channels"
	depends on RPMSG || (COMPILE_TEST && RPMSG=n)
	---help---
	  Say Y here to support SMD based ipcrouter channels.  SMD is the
	  most common transport for IPC Router.

config QRTR_TUN
	tristate "TUN device for Qualcomm IPC Router"
	---help---
	  Say Y here to expose a character device that allows user space to
	  implement endpoints of QRTR, for purpose of tunneling data to other
	  hosts or testing purposes.
