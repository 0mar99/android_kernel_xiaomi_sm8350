	  This enables the thermal sysfs driver for the TSENS device. It shows
	  up in Sysfs as a thermal zone with multiple trip points. Disabling the

	  This enables a thermal sysfs driver for Qualcomm plug-and-play (QPNP)
	  PMIC devices. It shows up in sysfs as a thermal sensor with multiple
	  trip points. The temperature reported by the thermal sensor reflects the
	  real time die temperature if an ADC is present or an estimate of the
	  temperature based upon the over temperature stage value.

	   This enables to list the QTI remote subsystem temperature sensors.
	   This driver can read the temperature of the remote sensor.
	   These sensors can take thresholds and notify the thermal

	  This driver provides routines to configure and monitor the BCL
	  PMIC peripheral. This driver registers the battery current and
	  voltage sensors with the thermal core framework and can take
	  threshold input and notify the thermal core when the threshold is
	  reached.

	  This driver registers battery state of charge as a sensor with
	  thermal framework. This sensor can monitor for state of charge
	  thresholds and notify the thermal framework when the thresholds
	  are reached and cleared. This will help to monitor and apply any
	  mitigation when state of charge goes below a certain threshold.

	   This enables the QTI CPU Isolation cooling devices. These cooling
	   devices will be used by QTI chipset to isolate a CPU from being
	   scheduled and hence will let the CPU to power collapse. Isolating
	   a CPU will be used when the CPU frequency mitigation
	   is not good enough to achieve the necessary cooling.
